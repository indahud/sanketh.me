summary: Easily convert image from URL into bas64 
---

Have you ever been in a situation where, you have URL of the image. But instead of URL you need to send the image in Base64 format.  
I have written a small function to achieve this. 
I will try to explain the code step by step ðŸ‘‡


```JavaScript
const axios = require('axios');

const convertToBase64 = async (imageUrl) => {
  const result = await axios.get(imageUrl, {
      responseType: 'arraybuffer',
	  headers: { Accept: 'image/*' },
  });
  const contentType = result.headers['content-type'];
  const base64Image = Buffer.from(result.data, 'binary').toString('base64');
  const previewImage = `data:${contentType};base64,${base64Image}`
  return previewImage;
};

const IMAGE_URL = "https://picsum.photos/id/91/200/300.jpg"
convertToBase64(IMAGE_URL);
```

To convert the image into bas64, we have to fetch the image first. I am using axios for fetching the image.

Few options are provided to axios while fetching the image. 
- #### responseType is arraybuffer because we are dealing with binary data. 
- #### headers are set to accept image of any type. 
With the help of wildcard `*` we are accepting image of any type. We might need image's mime type / content type while previewing the image.    

result will return array buffer data and its content-type will be in headers. 

We will create Buffer object from binary data. We will use `Buffer.from()` method for it. It accepts 2 parameters. 
First parameter is binary data and second is encoding. 

`toString()` method will convert data into base64 string.

To preview the base64 image we need to use certain data URI
- #### data - is prefix for the URI
- #### contentType: specifies the mime type (type of image .jpg, .png etc.)
- #### ;base64,: indicates that the data is base64 encoded.  

If everything went well then you can preview your base64 image [here](https://jaredwinick.github.io/base64-image-viewer)

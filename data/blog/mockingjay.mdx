summary: Mock API to create UI without any backend.
---

### Little back story

At current organisation, I work mostly on backend side (ExpressJS, MongoDB).  
Sometimes what happens is, I am working on some functionality. The work is in progress. I am supposed to deliver
the functionality in x hours but because of some technical issue I couldn't deliver it in x hours.
Frontend guy is waiting for API to integrate it on the UI side. 

I felt terrible somebody is not able to work because of me. But then I realised this is coding unexpected things always happens. 
Nobody can be certain that unexpected things are not going to happen.

I thought it might take some time to deliver the functionality. But I do know how the final response will be.
Why not create a side project where users will be able to get specific data in the response. This way frontend guy doesn't have to wait anymore.

> This project is very much work in progress.


### Tech Stack
- NextJS with Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase for PostgreSQL
- Stripe for Payment
- Prisma

> Users will be able to create Mock API. Where they can use different methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to add JSON data in the response.

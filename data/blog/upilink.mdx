summary: Accept UPI payment through link
---

I created this project because I wanted to accept UPI Payments through single link.
[getupilink](https://getupilink.com) makes it easy to accept the upi payment. 

Link creator can enter their UPI ID and amount.
Person who is paying can scan the QR code if they are on their computer/desktop 
or they can directly open the link in any UPI supported app.
